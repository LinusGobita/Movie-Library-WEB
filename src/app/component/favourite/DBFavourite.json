Through this autobiographic feature length film we explore the people, places, and portions of Boosie’s life most formative. Through the lens of the legendary creator himself. We peer through the veil, and into the heart of a man; unhinged, and unwavering in his pursuit of greatness.  Orson Wells, author of War of the Worlds, once described his masterpiece, Citizen Kane as an exploration of character rather than an exposition of conflict. This film follows the same philosophy. It’s not often you can say that Citizen Kane and Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" have anything in common, but through both works we feel closer to the creator.",

The word flows from the tongue naming the pleasure of earthly life and judging it as beautiful, but shallow and useless; vanity is a deadly sin. A female sin. The man painted the woman, put a mirror in his hands and called it vanity. The woman in representation admires herself, but the one who really admires her body is the artist. Whose vanity? In VANITAS, we re-divide the woman in our bodies, showing the depth of what is palpable. If the Father's temple hides after death, clean and perfect, we reject them. We welcome Mother Nature in us, life-death in a perpetual sacred cycle, also honoring her dark face. You may wish to reach heaven, but it is on earth that your knees fall.",
